## Command-Line Digital Preservation Utilities

This script includes the following subcommands:

  - bytecount (bc): Sum the bytes of (visible) files in the specified path, and count them by extension.
  - inventory (inv): Create a CSV containing file metadata for all visible files in the specified path. Write CSV to output file or to stdout for further processing. Resume previously interrupted jobs by specifying path to an existing (with -e flag) partial inventory file.
  - compare (comp): Compare lists of files generated by various untilities, including this script, tab-delimited File Analyzer reports, or Tivoli Storage Manager Backup reports to ensure that the filesets are identical.
  - verify (ver): Compare an existing inventory CSVs or an inventory generated at runtime, by comparing filenames and checksums (in the current implementation, filenames are assumed to be unique).
