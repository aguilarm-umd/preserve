# Command-Line Digital Preservation Utilities

## Versioning

* 0.6.0 and earlier - Designed for pasty v1
* 2.0.0 and later - Designed for use with patsy v2

Version 1.0 was skipped to keep versions in line with other tools.

## Usage

This script includes the following subcommands:

* bytecount (bc): Sum the bytes of (visible) files in the specified path, and also count them by extension.
* inventory (inv): Create a CSV report containing file metadata for all visible files in the specified path. Write CSV to an output file (specified with -o flag) or send the data to stdout for further processing. Resume previously interrupted jobs by specifying path to an existing (with -e flag) partial inventory file.
* compare (comp): Compare two or more file lists previously generated by various utilities, to ensure that the filesets are identical. Supported report formats include ones created by this script, tab-delimited File Analyzer reports, and Tivoli Storage Manager Backup reports.
* verify (ver): Compare two existing inventory CSVs or inventories generated at runtime, by verifying their filenames and checksums. If differences are detected, the script will attempt to reason about the nature of the differences (whether files have been changed in place, moved, added, or deleted).

To install, clone this repository and do:

```
python3 setup.py install
```

Run the various subcommands as follows:

```
preserve bytecount [path]
preserve inventory [path] (-o OUTFILE) (-e EXISTING)
preserve compare [file1] [file2] ...
preserve verify [file1|path1] [file2|path2]
```

Or, for a full list of options:

```
preserve -h
```
